# Entity Registry Validator - Documentation

## Overview

The Entity Registry validator is a fundamental component of the Amana Chain Entities platform. It serves as the identity layer that manages SACCO entities and their members on the Cardano blockchain. This document provides an overview of its implementation, functionality, and usage guidelines.

## Core Functionality

The Entity Registry validator provides the following key functions:

1. **Entity Creation** - Establishing a new SACCO with initial parameters
2. **Member Management** - Adding members and updating their status
3. **Admin Management** - Adding and removing administrative users

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures

The validator uses the following primary data structures:

- **Entity** - Stores metadata about a SACCO (name, description, creation time, founder, member count)
- **Member** - Represents a SACCO member (name, verification key hash, join time, status)
- **RegistryDatum** - On-chain state containing the entity, members list, and admins list

### Actions

The validator supports five different actions via its redeemer:

1. **CreateEntity** - Initialize a new SACCO entity
2. **AddMember** - Add a new member to an existing entity
3. **UpdateMemberStatus** - Change a member's status (Active, Inactive, Suspended)
4. **AddAdmin** - Add a new administrator to the entity
5. **RemoveAdmin** - Remove an existing administrator

### Validation Logic

Each action implements specific validation checks:

#### CreateEntity
- Only allowed during initial setup (when no datum exists)
- Entity name and description must be non-empty
- Transaction must be signed by at least one key (becomes the founder)
- Output datum must be properly formatted with the entity details, founder as admin, and empty members list

#### AddMember
- Transaction must be signed by an existing admin
- Member must not already exist
- Member data must be valid (non-empty name, valid join time)
- Output datum must properly include the new member while preserving existing members
- Entity's member count must be incremented by one

#### UpdateMemberStatus
- Transaction must be signed by an existing admin
- Member must exist
- Output datum must update only the specified member's status while preserving other data
- Member count must remain unchanged

#### AddAdmin
- Transaction must be signed by an existing admin
- New admin must not already exist in the admin list
- Output datum must include the new admin while preserving existing admins

#### RemoveAdmin
- Transaction must be signed by an existing admin
- Admin to remove must exist
- Cannot remove the last admin
- Output datum must remove only the specified admin while preserving other admins

## Usage Guidelines

### Initial Setup

To deploy a new SACCO, follow these steps:

1. Generate a transaction that includes:
   - A redeemer of type `CreateEntity` with SACCO name and description
   - A properly formatted output with inline datum containing entity details
   - The founder's signature

2. After successful validation, the entity is registered on-chain with:
   - The transaction signer as both founder and initial admin
   - Zero initial members
   - A complete entity record with creation timestamp

### Member Operations

To add or update members:

1. Create a transaction signed by an admin with:
   - For adding: A redeemer of type `AddMember` with complete member details
   - For status updates: A redeemer of type `UpdateMemberStatus` with member key and new status
   - A properly formatted output datum with updated member information

2. The validator ensures:
   - Only authorized admins can modify membership
   - No duplicate members are added
   - Status changes only affect the specified member

### Admin Operations

To add or remove admins:

1. Create a transaction signed by an existing admin with:
   - For adding: A redeemer of type `AddAdmin` with the new admin's verification key hash
   - For removing: A redeemer of type `RemoveAdmin` with the admin's verification key hash
   - A properly formatted output datum with updated admin list

2. The validator ensures:
   - Only existing admins can modify the admin list
   - At least one admin always remains to maintain control

## Best Practices

1. **Transaction Structure**
   - Always include exactly one output with an inline datum for validator state updates
   - Ensure the output datum is correctly formatted with all required fields

2. **Authorization**
   - Use the appropriate signer for each action type
   - Remember that only admins can modify entity data after initial creation

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Preserve existing data when updating specific fields
   - Ensure member counts and admin lists remain consistent

4. **Testing**
   - Thoroughly test all operations before deploying to mainnet
   - Use the provided test suite to verify validator behavior

## Integration with Other Contracts

The Entity Registry is designed to work alongside other Amana CE contracts:

- **Treasury Management Contract** - Verifies member identity by consulting the Entity Registry
- **Governance Contract** - Checks admin permissions and member eligibility for voting

When integrating with these contracts, use the Entity Registry's hash as a parameter to enable cross-contract validation.

## Limitations and Future Enhancements

Current limitations include:

- Basic member information without complex KYC
- No automated membership expiry or renewal
- Limited member metadata fields
- Simple role system (admin/non-admin)

Future enhancements could include:

- Delegation of admin powers
- Tiered membership levels
- Reputation systems
- More comprehensive member profiles
