# Amana CE Smart Contract Project Structure

## Overview

The Amana Chain Entities (Amana CE) smart contracts are designed to provide a modular blockchain-based solution for Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations (SACCOs) in Africa. The implementation follows Aiken's project structure conventions and modular design principles to allow SACCOs to adopt specific components based on their needs.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a library-based structure that separates type definitions, validation logic, and validator implementations:

```

## Key Components

### Common Utilities

- **constants.ak**: Contains system-wide parameters and thresholds used across all modules.
- **types.ak**: Defines shared type definitions used across multiple modules, including status enums and key types.
- **utils.ak**: Provides utility functions for common operations like signature verification and time validation.

### Entity Module

- **types.ak**: Defines data structures for entities and members.
- **validators.ak**: Contains validation logic for entity creation, member management, and entity configuration.
- **entity_registry.ak**: Implements the entity registry validator that handles the creation and management of SACCOs.

### Treasury Module

- **types.ak**: Defines data structures for treasury operations and transactions.
- **validators.ak**: Contains validation logic for financial operations and multi-signature approvals.
- **treasury.ak**: Implements the treasury validator that manages funds and financial operations.

### Governance Module

- **types.ak**: Defines data structures for proposals, votes, and governance actions.
- **validators.ak**: Contains validation logic for proposal creation, voting, and execution.
- **governance.ak**: Implements the governance validator that enables democratic decision-making.

## Design Patterns

### Modular Architecture

The smart contracts are designed with modularity in mind:

1. **Type Separation**: Clear separation between type definitions and validation logic.
2. **Reusable Validators**: Validation functions are separated from the main validator endpoints for reusability.
3. **Common Utils**: Shared utilities for signature verification and time validation are centralized.

### Datum and Redeemer Pattern

The smart contracts use the datum-redeemer pattern effectively:

1. **Datum**: Stores the current state of entities, treasuries, and governance.
2. **Redeemer**: Contains the action to be performed and associated parameters.
3. **Context**: Used to validate transaction signatures, time constraints, and conditions.

### Multi-signature Implementation

The treasury validator implements multi-signature functionality:

1. **Transaction Proposal**: Any admin can propose a transaction.
2. **Approval Collection**: Multiple admins can provide approvals.
3. **Threshold Validation**: Transactions are executed only when sufficient approvals are gathered.

## Usage Flow

1. **Entity Creation**:
   - Create a SACCO entity using the entity_registry validator.
   - Initial administrators are registered automatically.

2. **Treasury Initialization**:
   - Initialize the treasury for the created entity.
   - Set required approval signatures and administrators.

3. **Member Registration**:
   - Add members to the entity using the entity_registry validator.

4. **Financial Operations**:
   - Members can deposit funds to the treasury.
   - Withdrawals require multi-signature approval from administrators.

5. **Governance Operations**:
   - Create proposals for entity changes or decisions.
   - Members vote on proposals during the voting period.
   - Approved proposals can be executed to implement changes.

## Implementation Notes

This implementation provides placeholder structures and validation logic that cover the core functionality described in the specifications. The actual implementation would require further development:

1. **Integration with Off-chain Components**: Connections to user interfaces and databases.
2. **Advanced Validation**: More comprehensive validation for complex operations.
3. **Testing**: Unit and integration testing for all validator functions.
4. **Security Auditing**: Thorough security review and optimization.
